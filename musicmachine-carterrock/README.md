The shell of the MusicMachine project.

The Music Machine takes in a .json file that gets parsed utilizing the nlohmann JSON parser. The .json file contains data on various music types, either Classical or Non Classical, and info such as the Artist, the song name, and so forth. The parsed file gets run through the program and the output is the information on each piece of music, catgeorized by whether it is Classical or Non Classical.<br />
